# Vulnerability Scanner in C++

This check only checks whether the obtained response is different from the expected response and, if it is, considers that there was a SQL injection vulnerability. This is just a basic example of how a SQL injection scanner could be implemented and is only for illustrative purposes.

Effective SQL injection vulnerability checking is much more complex and requires analyzing the response of the request in search of patterns or indicators that may indicate vulnerability. In addition, various factors must be considered, such as the type of database, the type of web application, the structure of the SQL query, and others. Some examples of more advanced SQL injection vulnerability checking techniques include analyzing syntax errors generated by the database, analyzing changes in the structure of the resulting page, and analyzing changes in the response time of the request.

In summary, SQL injection vulnerability checking is a complex task and requires careful analysis of the response of the request to detect signs of vulnerability. The provided example is just a basic example and should not be used as the basis for a truly effective SQL injection vulnerability check.

My idea is just to show my skills in C++ and nothing better than to apply pentesting practices in my project.

See you soon!
